The developer image is displayed in a circular shape with a light gray border. Below the image, the developer's name, role, and a custom tagline are showcased.

A button labeled "Show Demo Portfolio" is provided for users to toggle the visibility of the demo projects. Clicking the button reveals a list of demo projects in a visually appealing layout. Each demo project is represented as a card, featuring the project name and a description. The cards have rounded corners and a light gray border.

Overall, the "Jetpack Developer Profile" app provides an elegant and user-friendly interface for users to explore a developer's profile and browse their demo projects.
